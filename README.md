Converts a bunch of images to a single pdf file.

This is a windows-only release.

In order to use, add image files using Open Image File dialog or simply drag and drop images to the program.

Then select an output file and hit Create PDF.

Only ran a few tests. Try to report bugs.

Explanation of Options:

Add: Adds an image to the list

Add dir: Adds all of the images of the same extension from the directory where the current image file was selected

Remove: Removes an image from the list

The program may look stuck while making the pdf if you have a lot of images to include.
This is normal and you don't need to panic, just wait for a while until it finishes.
